      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        AutoFi was created by five UCI students who saw how complex and overwhelming DeFi could be for beginners.
        With our background in tech, we wanted to build something that simplifies decentralized finance and makes it 
        more accessible to everyday users.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our goal is to create a user-friendly AI-powered DeFi assistant that helps users explore DeFi, manage assets,
        and make informed decisionsâ€”without needing deep technical or financial expertise. We're still learning and 
        growing, but weâ€™re excited to bring innovation to the space and make DeFi easier for everyone. ðŸš€
      </p>
